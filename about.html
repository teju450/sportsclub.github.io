NSCI’s long and rich history has always been closely associated with the pre-eminent leaders of a free India. With the foresight required to build a nation that could compete with any other, a great vision was formulated more than just a policy for promoting games and sports in the country,
						it was about building a community for those that championed the virtues of hard work, fair competition and national pride.</p>
